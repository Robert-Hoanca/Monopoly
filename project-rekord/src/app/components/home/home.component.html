Welcome to the world of Monopoly!

About the Creator:
Greetings, fellow gamers! I am [Your Name], a 20-year-old junior front-end developer based in Italy, and the imaginative mind behind this thrilling 3D game heavily inspired by the timeless classic, Monopoly. As an avid fan of both board games and cutting-edge technology, I embarked on a journey to recreate the Monopoly experience in a whole new dimension, with a minimalist twist.

About the Game:
Monopoly takes the essence of the beloved board game and adds an extra layer of excitement by immersing you in a fully realized 3D world, while embracing a minimalistic aesthetic. Prepare to embark on a strategic journey of property trading, decision-making, and dice rolls as you compete against your friends or AI opponents to dominate the game board.

Featuring a sleek and minimalist design, Monopoly strips away the clutter to provide a clean and focused gameplay experience. Engage in intense negotiations, build iconic properties, and amass your fortune while cleverly sabotaging your opponents' plans. Don't forget to keep an eye out for unexpected events that can quickly change the course of the game!

Technologies Used:
To bring Monopoly to life, I harnessed the power of cutting-edge technologies and utilized a combination of industry-standard tools. My development arsenal included:

Blender: The versatile 3D modeling software that helped me meticulously craft the captivating world and its charismatic characters, while maintaining the minimalist aesthetic.

Angular: The JavaScript framework that provided a solid foundation for building the game's user interface and handling the frontend logic with simplicity and elegance.

RxJS: The reactive programming library that added powerful event handling and asynchronous capabilities, ensuring smooth interactions and real-time updates within the game.

Three.js: The lightweight 3D graphics library that allowed me to create visually appealing, yet minimalistic environments that perfectly complement the gameplay.

Cannon.js: The physics engine that brought realistic motion and collision detection to Monopoly, adding depth and interactivity to the gameplay experience.

Firebase: The comprehensive platform that handled user authentication, real-time data synchronization, and cloud storage, enabling seamless multiplayer functionality and cross-platform compatibility.

Rest assured, I've poured my heart, soul, and countless cups of coffee into every line of code, every pixel rendered, and every design decision to ensure Monopoly delivers an unforgettable gaming experience with a minimalist touch.

So, gather your friends, roll the dice, and let the Monopoly journey begin!
